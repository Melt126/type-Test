Nothing changed! You haven't changed one bit, dammit! You're still as useless as you were! Nothing changed!	<img src='images/AOT.jpg'>	Attack on Titan - Hajime Isayama
You don't get it. It's more satisying to hear a single "thank you" than a lot of "sorry's". I did it because I wanted to help, not because I wanted an apology.	<img src='images/ReZero.jpg'>	Re:Zero - Tappei Nagatsuki
This is also a punishment for you. You will be the defender of justice and wear a mask forever... You will no longer be able to live as Kururugi Suzaku. You will sacrifice all of your own happiness for the world... eternally.	<img src='images/CodeGeass.jpg'>	Code Geass - Gorō Taniguchi
There was no other way! The world had to be fixed! A purpose given to me! Only I could do it. Who else could have done it, and come this far?	<img src='images/DeathNote.jpg'>	Death Note - Tsugumi Ohba
I believe in you all. No matter how devastated you may be by your own weakness or uselessness... set your heart ablaze.	<img src='images/DemonSlayer.jpg'>	Demon Slayer: Mugen Train - Haruo Sotozaki
Humanity isn't going down that easily. Two million years of human history is right here inside me.	<img src='images/DrStone.jpg'>	Dr.Stone - Riichiro Inagaki
I wish there was a way to know you're in the good old days.. before you've actually left them.	<img src='images/Office.jpg'>	The Office - Michael Herbert Schur
Would you say that of our slain comrades? What about their lives? Were they meaningless? They were not! Their memory serves as an example to us all! The courageous fallen, the anguished fallen, their lives have meaning because we the living refuse to forget them!	<img src='images/AOT.jpg'>	Attack on Titan - Hajime Isayama
Fighting for others, but not yourself, is nothing but hypocrisy.	<img src='images/Fate.jpg'>	Fate:Stay Night - Kinoko Nasu
We are just ordinary people driven to revenge in the name of justice. But if revenge is called justice, then that justice breeds yet more revenge and becomes a chain of hatred.	<img src='images/Naruto.jpg'>	Naruto - Masashi Kishimoto
If it's true love, I'm prepared to even accept expulsion.	<img src='images/Kaguya.jpg'>	Kaguyasama Love is War - Aka Akasaka
There's no way we could meet. But one thing is certain. If we see each other, we'll know. That you were the one who was inside me. That I was the one who was inside you.	<img src='images/YourName.jpg'>	Your Name - Makoto Shinkai
You're right, humans are full of lies; but sometimes it's only because we're afraid of getting hurt.	<img src='images/Pancreas.jpg'>	I want to eat your pancreas - Yoru Sumino

That day, I let a weak man die. And another was reborn. Betrayal, that pain that feels like it’ll eat you inside out, can either break you, or forge you into something greater. You need to let Powder die, so the fear of pain can no longer control you. You are strong now, just like you were always meant to be. Jinx if perfect.	<img src='images/Arcane.jpg'>	Arcane: League of Legends - Christian Linke and Alex Yee
